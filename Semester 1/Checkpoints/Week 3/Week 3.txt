1. What is Bubble Sort? Briefly explain how it works. 

Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that examines each pair and determines which one of the two is greater. Depending on the
goal of the sort (smallest to largest or vice versa) the two will swap places. This continues; by the end of the first pass 
through the largest/smallest number is guarenteed at the end of the list. The sort repeats until the list is sorted.

2. What is a Comparator? Why would I use one?
A comparator is an object that is a way of comparing two objects in a way that is defined by the user, similar to comparable. 
HOWEVER: comparators do not require any method to be defined within the class that you are comparing. This makes it easier 
to compare objects at the location of the comparison, vs. having a natural comparison order that is followed based on the class
that is being compared. It allows multiple comparabtors to be used on the same data as well.
